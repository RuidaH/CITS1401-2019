open a file, and go through a loop
read all the lines one by one
split them using back selection 
if the line is not empty, then keep it otherwise delete it
and return the final variable

it is a loop
reading the file entirely
and then we try to find out the file
each line we have the back selection
if there is just a blank line, we just want to ignore it
and other lines we just concatenate them and return them
